# Train_Schedueler

-- This is an app to track a trains schedule.

-- Each train is saved to the Firebase database and can be referenced at anytime

-- This app allows you to add your own train with the destination, what time the first train leaves (start time), and how frequently the train visits the stop.

-- Based off those user inputs the app calculates how many minutes until the next train arrives.
